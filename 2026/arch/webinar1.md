* camera
* sonar to create maps

    * from a tablet to create 3d model of objects
* GPR - ground penetration radar (many blobs and poor results)
* Pre-excavation research and deciding when and where to excavate
* xray on found artifacts
* 3d scanners and 3d print to enlarge


## challenges
* checklist not to forget anything
* no common db cross wide and many GIS data types
* working in sunny places but not using enough solar panels
* Lack of electricity and other modern facilities on site.
* electronics are effected by heat or dust especial the ones work with fans; not leaving electronics on the sum as they overheat;
* also using camera underwater battery freeze
* if we leave a site overnight or for months between seasons, we need to protect it.
* 


## preserving
* XRF - identify what items are made of to preserve them with the right materials;
* how to preserver organic materials
*  For example, bronze is known to disintegrate (sometimes within minutes!) due to a condition we call “bronze disease.”
